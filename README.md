Week 4 Project - Getting and Cleaing Data
This script creates a summary of human activity measurements collected during normal activities.  The dataset was developed from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (HAR) from UCI.  The output of the project is a summary file titled tidy.txt. 
The project has developed the following files:run_analysis.R -- the R script which downloads the original HAR dataset and creates the tidy.txt file.  

The run_analysis.R script should be loaded into R or RStudio, and simply executed to produce the tidy.txt file.
